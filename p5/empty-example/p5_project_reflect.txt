        We learned alot about p5 during this project and this was a good project as it made something fun that we could use and gave
    us a sense of accomplishment by having us create something substitantive and enjoyable. I think working with project partners is
    a good way to run this project because the effect of having two minds instead of 1 is tremendous, and through switching, allows
    the work to be evenly split between two people and ensures fairness. We hed two issues in developement which where the ideas of
    how to get the ball moving diagonally instead of straight forward, we did this by making the xvelocity change so that the ball
    would move to the side and up so that is would be moving in a diagonal direction. The other was when we didnt know how to get
    the ball to make the brick dissapear. We also thought that this algorythim was the most difficult to make. We made the balls x
    and y velocities set to zero when it made contact with the box so that it would stop and the box had its borders deleted so that
    it could blend in when we changed it color to give the appearence of it dissappearing. Then the message, "You Win!" would be
    displayed, congragulating the player.
