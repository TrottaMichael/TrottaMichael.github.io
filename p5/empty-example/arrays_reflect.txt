            The method of using arrays taught in this program to create multiple shapes is very useful because it avoids the
        repetition that just typing things over and over again because it teaches nothing and just wastes time by repeatedly going
        over and over while just memorizing the way that you make that exact circle. My array takes the creation of a single circle
        that it repeats all over the canvas, meaning that the circles are all identical in appearance with the execption of their
        position on the canvas and makes them move around by randomly moving them in both the x and y value by a random value
        between two and negative two. I was unclear on how objects worked so I would say my aha moment was when I learned how they
        worked, because it was integral to the entire project, which made it very important.
